# 7. Scale it

* Create a replicaset **pets**
  * Add a label `app: pets` and `tier: backend`
  * Use data from previosuly created pod to create a `template` definition
  * Use both labels when creating a selector matching pods (`app: pets` **and** `tier: backend`)
  * Use more than 1 replicas (e.g. 3)
  * Save its definition under **k8s/rs/pets-rs.yaml**
* Remember to include all elements configured for a standalone pod!
* Delete standalone pets pods if there are still running and create a new replicaset using newly created definition file

> Don't forget to push all changes to git repo!
