# 12. Start using your app!

* Create a Deployment
  * Save its definition under **k8s/deploy/pets-deployment.yaml**
  * Add a label `app: pets` and `tier: db`
  * Use configuration data from previously created ReplicaSet for template section
* Add to the configmap a new variable `DB` with a value pointing to consul service's **fqdn**
* Apply new configmap and reload your app e.g.
  * scale it to 0 and scale it back
  * OR delete all pods matching label `app=pets`

**You should now be able to use admin backend and vote for your favourite pet!**
