# 8. Expose using services

* Create a new service **pets-cluster**
  * Add a label `app: pets` and `tier: web`
  * Set type to **ClusterIP**
  * Expose pod's port named **http** also as named port **http** on service port=80
  * Expose pod's port named **admin** also as named port **admin** on service port=8080
  * Use both labels when creating a selector (`app: pets` **and** `tier: web`)
  * Save its definition under **k8s/svc/pets-svc-cluster.yaml**
* Create a service and check it from temporary pod (use `curl pets-cluster`)

* Similarily create a service **pets-node** with the following differences
  * Set type to **NodePort**
  * Save its definition under **k8s/svc/pets-svc-node.yaml**
* Check node's port in service status and connect to it from your host
